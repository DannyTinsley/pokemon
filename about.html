In addition, the Pokémon franchise includes the world's top-selling toy brand,[18] the top-selling trading card game with over 25.7 billion cards sold, an anime television series that has become the most successful video game adaptation with over 20 seasons and 1,000 episodes in 124 countries, as well as an anime film series, a live-action film, books, manga comics, music, and merchandise.
